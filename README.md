## RPPS
RPPS (or Rapid Protocol Prototyping Solution) is a set of tools and classes which allow fast, easy and consistent development for device protocols. Just define your protocol using set of XML files in a text editor or using Protocol Editor provided by RPPS and generate supporting infrastructure C++ classes which should provide datagram parsing, dispatching, serialization/diserialization, create basic device protocol emulation facility as well as to be able to check protocol consistency/coherence and test using basic emulation. Also, it provides a set of comprehensive transport classes (Serial/TCP/UDP/HTTP) specifically designed to work with the generated code base.

It's written in C++ using Qt framework (4/5).

### Features
- Supports regular C++ types as datagram fields
- Supports custom structures, enumerations and bit fields as datagram fields
- Supports fi—áed-size fields (arrays)
- Variable-sized fields including custom types
- Supports arbitrary number of variable-sized fields
- Supports arbitrary number of checksum (CRC) fields according to given protocol definition
- Checks protocol consistency/coherence prior to code generation
- Creates basic protocol emulation and tests
