## RPPS
RPPS (or Rapid Protocol Prototyping Solution) is a set of tools and classes which allow fast, easy and consistent development for device protocols. Just define your protocol using set of XML files in a text editor or using Protocol Editor provided by RPPS and generate supporting infrastructure classes which should provide datagram parsing, dispatching, serialization/diserialization, create basic device protocol emulation facility as well as to be able to check protocol consistency/coherence and test using basic emulation. Also, it provides a set of comprehensive transport classes (Serial/TCP/UDP/HTTP) specifically designed to work with the generated code base.

It's written in C++ using Qt framework.
